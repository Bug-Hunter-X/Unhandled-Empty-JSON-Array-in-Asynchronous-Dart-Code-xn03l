# Unhandled Empty JSON Array in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart when working with asynchronous operations and JSON data: accessing elements of a JSON array without checking for emptiness. The code fetches data from an API, parses the JSON response, and attempts to access the first element. If the array is empty, it results in an error.

The `bug.dart` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.dart` provides a corrected version that handles the empty array scenario gracefully.

This example highlights the importance of defensive programming when dealing with external data sources.
